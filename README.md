> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### ⚠️ RESEARCH PROTOTYPE & EVALUATION DISCLAIMER
> **Notice for Evaluators and Reviewing Authorities:**
> 1. **Research Prototype**: TraceX Sahyog is an academic research prototype developed for Smart India Hackathon (Problem Statement ID: SIH26182).
> 2. **Synthetic Demo Data**: All preloaded benchmark scenarios, addresses, transaction hashes, and figures utilize *synthetic demo data*. No actual complainant, suspect KYC, or restricted law enforcement intelligence data is utilized.
> 3. **Probabilistic Attribution**: On-chain clustering outputs and VASP identification represent *probabilistic attribution* based on graph heuristics, not deterministic mathematical proof.
> 4. **Draft for Review by Authorized Agencies**: TraceX is designed strictly as an investigative decision-support system. All generated Section 91 directives, dossiers, and evidence summaries represent a *draft for review by authorized agencies*. Final action requires formal verification and authorized dispatch by accredited officials.

## 📌 Problem Context & Executive Summary

In cyber financial crimes (task-based scams, impersonation frauds, extortion, and ransomware), perpetrators rapidly disperse stolen victim funds across unhosted, non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., MetaMask, TrustWallet, private TRON/BTC addresses) that carry no Know-Your-Customer (KYC) records.

**TraceX Sahyog** bridges the gap between raw blockchain explorer data and actionable statutory requisitions for Indian Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). It algorithmically traces multi-hop layering paths, isolates intermediary mule accounts, identifies where fund flows converge into regulated Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs such as CoinDCX, WazirX, Binance), and generates pre-formatted draft **Section 91 BNSS, 2023** (formerly Section 91 CrPC) preservation directives for authorized police review.

## 🏛️ Why This Matters for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs)

```mermaid

    A["⏱️ Golden Hour Window<br/>(Funds moved in 30-60 min)"] --> B["⛓️ 3-6 Unhosted Mule Wallets<br/>(Manual trace takes days)"]
    B --> C["🎯 Automated VASP Convergence<br/>(TraceX identifies FIU-IND exchange)"]
    C --> D["⚖️ Draft Sec 91 BNSS Notice<br/>(Ready for IO review & dispatch)"]
```

### 1. The "Golden Hour" Bottleneck in Crypto Investigations
When a cybercrime victim reports stolen cryptocurrency, the first 30 to 60 minutes are critical. Cybercrime syndicates systematically split and funnel funds through **3 to 6 unhosted mule wallets** within minutes. In manual investigations, an officer must navigate multiple fragmented public block explorers, paste transaction hashes into spreadsheets, and manually cross-reference deposit addresses—a process that typically consumes **48 to 72 hours**. By that time, the perpetrator has liquidated the cryptocurrency into fiat through P2P desks or moved it offshore. TraceX executes multi-hop graph traversal and identifies the recipient gateway in **under 5 seconds**.

### 2. Automated Convergence on Regulated VASPs
Unhosted wallets carry no verified identity. A suspect can only be apprehended or funds seized when the cryptocurrency touches a regulated **Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP)**. In India, reporting entities registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND) maintain verified KYC documents (Aadhaar, PAN, Video KYC), bank account details, phone numbers, and login IP address logs. TraceX's heuristic clustering isolates these regulated exchange deposit addresses from unhosted mule hops.

### 3. Rapid Statutory Requisition Generation (Section 91 BNSS)
Identifying the exchange is useless if the preservation requisition arrives after funds have been withdrawn. TraceX automatically pre-populates formal legal notice drafts under **Section 91 BNSS, 2023** with verified compliance nodal officer email addresses, exact transaction hashes, destination deposit addresses, and timestamped forensic evidence—allowing the Investigating Officer (IO) to immediately review, sign, and serve the order within the golden hour.

## 🔄 Grounded 6-Step Investigator Workflow

TraceX structures blockchain forensics into an intuitive, legally grounded 6-stage decision-support pipeline:

```
[1. Case Intake & Target Input]
       │
       ▼
[2. Blockchain Trace (Multi-Hop Graph Traversal)]
       │
       ▼
[3. Heuristic VASP Match (FIU-IND Registered Gateway)]
       │
       ▼
[4. Confidence Score (Calibrated Heuristic, e.g. 74% Medium-High)]
       │
       ▼
[5. Supporting Cryptographic Evidence & FATF Typology Tags]
       │
       ▼
[6. Investigating Officer (IO) Review & Authorization Required]
```

1. **Step 01 — Case Intake**: Input suspect cryptocurrency address; automated regex detection identifies network (Bitcoin, Ethereum, TRON, Solana).
2. **Step 02 — Blockchain Trace**: Automated directed graph traversal follows fund flows across intermediary hops and peel chains.
3. **Step 03 — VASP Match**: Algorithmic clustering identifies the most probable regulated centralized exchange deposit gateway.
4. **Step 04 — Confidence Score**: Generates a calibrated probabilistic confidence rating (e.g., 74% Medium-High) with heuristic factor decomposition.
5. **Step 05 — Supporting Evidence**: Assembles cryptographic transaction hashes, chronological hop timestamps, and FATF AML red flag indicators.
6. **Step 06 — IO Approval Required**: Prepares the draft Section 91 BNSS requisition for formal review by authorized agencies, verification, and formal sign-off by the human officer.

- Exports to clipboard, plaintext format (`.txt`), and judicial case diary format.

### 4. 🤖 Prototype AI Copilot (LLM-Assisted Reasoning)
- Integrated prototype forensic reasoning copilot utilizing multi-provider LLM inference (**Google Gemini** / **Groq LPU**) with rule-based fallback.

## ⚠️ System Limitations & Grounded Technical Realities

To maintain scientific credibility and prevent false expectations, TraceX explicitly documents its research boundaries:

| Limitation Area | Technical Reality & Research Boundary | Mitigation / Investigator Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Probabilistic Attribution** | On-chain clustering heuristics identify the *most probable* exchange gateway. It does not constitute internal exchange ledger access. | Conclusive legal attribution requires formal confirmation from the recipient VASP via Section 91 notice. |
| **Upstream API Dependencies** | The prototype queries public and developer-tier RPC indexers (Etherscan, TronGrid, Esplora). High query volumes may encounter rate limits. | Production deployments require dedicated, sovereign MHA archival full-node clusters. |
| **Mixer & Cross-Chain Breaks** | Zero-knowledge mixing protocols (e.g., Tornado Cash) and cross-chain privacy bridges sever direct graph linkage. | TraceX flags the break as an AML typology alert rather than attempting false deterministic linkages. |
| **Human-in-the-Loop Protocol** | TraceX is a decision-support platform. It cannot autonomously freeze bank accounts or issue binding legal summons. | Strict requirement for human Investigating Officer (IO) review, verification, and authorized signature. |
